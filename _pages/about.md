#### PERSONAL

------
I’m a strong believer in lifelong learning and have a wide range of interests, though I sometimes keep them a bit surface-level. The one thing that’s stuck with me for the long haul? Research. It’s both thrilling and, occasionally, torturous.

##### *A few fun things about me:*

- **Board games**: I enjoy [guandan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guandan) and [mahjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong).
- **Music**: My playlists span pop, indie, R&B, disco funk, with a dash of hip-hop. I listen to music for over 100,000 minutes a year, which averages out to about 4.6 hours per day. I’m usually wearing AirPods, though, to be honest, they’re probably not playing music most of the time.
- **Dancing**: Waacking is my favourite. You might catch me trying out some unskilled voguing (old way & vogue femme).
- **Sports**: I play badminton, and jog to clear my mind.
- I lean politically left, with strong feminist and open-minded values. While I enjoy meaningful discussions with people of all ideologies, I prefer to avoid needless controversies. Silence is my way of dodging conflict, so if I’m quiet, don’t worry—I’m just keeping the peace!
- I care deeply about **feminism**. I identify as a [**Marxist feminist**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_feminism). Marxist feminism focuses on how capitalism contributes to women's oppression and advocates for dismantling both capitalist structures and patriarchy to achieve true gender equality.

##### *Some more quirks:*

- I love animals but feel conflicted about zoos. I love sloths, gorillas, squirrels and otters.
- Nature > Fashion, any day.
- I don't speak perfect English. Sometimes I speak Chinglish.

##### *MBTI*

- ENFP/INFP

  *I usually vacillate on test between ‘E’ and ‘I’. Usually this means that the [NF archetype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_temperament) is much stronger than the single value for ‘E/I’.*
