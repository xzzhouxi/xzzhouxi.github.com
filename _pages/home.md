Welcome to Xi's Research Hub!

Nature acts as a giant methane reactor, with billions of microbes influencing global carbon cycles. My journey began at China Agricultural University, where my fascination with microbes took off. Join me as we explore the hidden world of methane cycling and microbial interactions!

I am a researcher in microbial ecology with a focus on archaea, viruses, and methane cycling. I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at China Agricultural University, where I studied methanogenic food webs in rice paddies under environmental stress.

My research investigates how microbes interact with their environment and how these interactions affect greenhouse gases and carbon cycles. I use bioinformatics techniques to study these processes.

I am currently working as a research assistant at the University of Hong Kong and will soon begin my PhD journey at Queensland University of Technology. I am excited to continue exploring the hidden roles of microbes in shaping our environment!
