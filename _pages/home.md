Welcome to Xi's Research Hub!

Nature acts as a giant methane reactor, with billions of microbes influencing global carbon cycles. My journey began at China Agricultural University, where my fascination with microbes took off. Join me as we explore the hidden world of methane cycling and microbial interactions!

I am a researcher in microbial ecology with a focus on archaea, viruses, and methane cycling. My research investigates how microbes interact with their environment and how these interactions affect greenhouse gases and carbon cycles.

I am currently a PhD student at the Centre for Microbiome Research (CMR) at Queensland University of Technology (QUT), studying anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and their microbial interactions.

#### Research Interests
