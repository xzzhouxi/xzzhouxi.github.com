Welcome to Xi's Research Hub!

Nature acts as a giant methane reactor, with billions of microbes influencing global carbon cycles. My journey began at China Agricultural University, where my fascination with microbes took off. Join me as we explore the hidden world of methane cycling and microbial interactions!

I am a researcher in microbial ecology, focusing on archaea, viruses, and methane cycling. I completed my MSc at China Agricultural University, where I explored methanogenic food webs in rice paddies under stress conditions.

My research investigates how microbes interact with their environment and how these interactions affect greenhouse gases and carbon cycles. I use bioinformatics techniques to study these processes and am interested in how viruses impact archaea and methanogensis.

**I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position** to advance my research in geomicrobiology and contribute to understanding microbial ecologyâ€™s role in environmental science and climate change.

#### Research Interests

- Microbial community ecology and evolution
- Archaeal biology
- Virus-host interaction
- Bioinformatics (and AI)
